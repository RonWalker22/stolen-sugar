## Discover Alternative Spoken Phrases for Talon and Cursorless 


![website screenshot of alternate spoken phrases](./src/images/website-screenshot.png)

### About

We steal spoken phrases from the various forks of knausj_talon and make them available to be searched by file. Cursorless spoken phrases are less available on github, so please consider donating your repository so more people can benefit.

Stolen Sugar was created by David Slater, Evan Pollak and Ron Walker.

### Website Voice Navigation

You can easily navigate the website with your voice by using the denoted hotkeys. Each hotkey is either a number or letter. If you have not mastered the talon alphabet yet, just say "seven" to look at the cheatsheet. After you link your repository, the entire website, including the cheatsheet, is mapped to your custom spoken phrases.

When you focus on an input element like "File Path", hotkeys are temporarily disabled.

### Repository Search Area

We execpt your talon repository to be a publicly available knausj_talon fork, otherwise we don't know it exists. If you have a knausj_talon fork, you are also on our cursorless search list. For cursorless we search through your github repos for a repository named "cursorless-settings". We also look within the top level of your talon fork for a folder named "cursorless-settings" on the chance you changed your cursorless settings directory to that location.
